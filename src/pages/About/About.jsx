            <p>
            Hey there! I’m Jason and I build everything from Discord bots to experimental AI projects, sprinkling creativity and a bit of stubborn determination into every line of code.

            When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me experimenting with digital art, tinkering with random gadgets, or trying (and sometimes failing) to explain my latest wild idea to friends.

          <Section title="My Journey">
            <p>
              What started as a curiosity about how games work turned into a deep dive into the
              world of programming. I began with Python, creating my first major project - a Discord
              bot named Arx that taught me valuable lessons about data management and user interaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since then, I've expanded my skills into web development, exploring technologies like
              React and Node.js to build more complex and interactive applications.
