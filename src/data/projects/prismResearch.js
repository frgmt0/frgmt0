  description: 'The PRISM framework represents a groundbreaking advancement in AI architecture, designed to move beyond traditional pattern-matching models. Unlike conventional large language models (LLMs) that operate as statistical predictors, PRISM introduces a unique blend of two-dimensional neural processing, knowledge graph integration, and a Checker Layer for logical validation. These components work together to create an AI system capable of principled reasoning, structured abstraction, and adaptive learning.',
