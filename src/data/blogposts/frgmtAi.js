# frgmt_ AI: Where AI Gets Its Groove Back

Welcome to **frgmt_** AKA **SoFragment**, the home of lightweight, modular AI systems built for people who don’t have time for bloated, resource-hogging nonsense. We’re not here to reinvent the wheel—we’re here to slap some turbojets on it and see how far we can send it flying.

## **Our Mission?**
To make AI your new sidekick—the Robin to your Batman, the Luigi to your Mario (or the Wario, depending on your vibe). With tools that are practical, punchy, and just a little unhinged, we’re here to show you what AI can *really* do.

## What’s Brewing in the frgmt_ Lab?

### SRN: Your Computer’s New Overlord (jk... kinda)
Meet **SRN**, our foundational **Small Action Model (SAM)** that doesn’t just sit around chatting—it *gets stuff done*. It’s like having a super-efficient intern who doesn’t take coffee breaks or accidentally reply-all.  

**What SRN Brings to the Table:**
- **Doer of Things**: Automates tasks, manages files, and handles all the boring stuff you don’t want to do.  
- **Lightweight AF**: Won’t slow your system down, unlike *some* AI models we won’t name (👀).  
- **Smarter Than It Looks**: Adapts to your workflow like it was born to be there.

### SLT-: Build Agents. Unleash... Something?
Coming soon, **SLT-** is the Swiss Army knife of AI frameworks. Want to build agents for your app or personal AI assistant? With **SLT-**, it’s as easy as pie—assuming you’ve ever made pie (which, let’s be real, can be kind of tricky). But **SLT-**? SLT-’s easy.  

**Why SLT- is a Game-Changer:**
- **Agents Galore**: Create specialized agents that actually *know what they’re doing*.  
- **Ridiculously Modular**: Fits into any project like it was meant to be there.  
- **Developer-Friendly**: Because struggling with tools is so last decade.

### fRM: Rust-Powered ORM for the Brave.
**fRM** is an **ORM for Rust**—but forget the heavy, over-engineered nonsense. fRM is fast, lean, and as sleek as its name suggests. Built *in Rust, for Rust*, it’s a developer’s dream if you’re tired of working with bulky, cumbersome systems.  

**Why fRM is a Power Move:**
- **Blazing Fast**: Rust isn’t slow, and neither is fRM.  
- **Sleek Design**: Minimal fluff, maximum performance.  
- **Rust to the Core**: No borrowed ideas here—just borrowed references.  

If you’ve been searching for a lightweight ORM that stays out of your way but gives you all the power, **fRM** is calling your name.

## Why frgmt_? Because Why Not?
Here’s the thing: most AI out there is either bloated, overly complicated, or just... meh. We’re here to fix that by building tools that:  
- Fit into your workflow like a glove. A really smart glove.  
- Actually help, instead of making you question your life choices.  
- Are more compact than your average IKEA manual but infinitely more useful.  

We’re all about minimal fluff, maximum punch. No jargon-y nonsense, just clever tools with a mischievous streak. If that sounds like your vibe, you’re in the right place.

## Join the Madness
We’re just getting started, which means now’s the perfect time to jump on the bandwagon. Whether you’re a developer, creator, or just someone who likes to see what AI can do, we’d love for you to join us.  

Thanks for stopping by **frgmt_**, where the AI is sharp, the sarcasm is sharper, and the possibilities are endless. Let’s make something epic together… or weird… we’re good with weird. :>
